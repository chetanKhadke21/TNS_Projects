### Contents
- `app.py` â€“ Flask app for serving predictions  
- `main.py` â€“ Core script to run the model  
- `Manufacturing Equipment Output.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter notebook with model training  
- `manufacturing_dataset_1000_samples.csv` â€“ Dataset used for training/testing  
- `linear_regression_model.pkl` â€“ Trained regression model  
- `scaler.pkl` â€“ Preprocessing scaler  
- `feature_columns.json` â€“ Feature metadata  
- `requirements.txt` â€“ Dependencies  

### How to Run
```bash
cd Project_1/Manufacturing
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
