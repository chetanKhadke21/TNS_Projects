# Project 1: Manufacturing Equipment Output Prediction

### Overview
This project predicts equipment output in a manufacturing setup using regression techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and deployment with a simple Flask app.

### Contents
- `app.py` – Flask app for serving predictions  
- `main.py` – Core script to run the model  
- `Manufacturing Equipment Output.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with model training  
- `manufacturing_dataset_1000_samples.csv` – Dataset used for training/testing  
- `linear_regression_model.pkl` – Trained regression model  
- `scaler.pkl` – Preprocessing scaler  
- `feature_columns.json` – Feature metadata  
- `requirements.txt` – Dependencies  

### How to Run
```bash
cd Project_1/Manufacturing
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```



# Project 2: Heart Disease Prediction

### Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using classification models. It includes dataset processing, model training, and deployment via Flask.
